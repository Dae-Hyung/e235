1) What is the purpose (or even the mission) of the Programming Historian project?
  I would say that the purpose of "The Programming Historian" is to help teach the basics and foundations to advanced tips and tricks of various forms of programming and coding to beginners of the art. 
2) Who is the audience for the project?
  The audience really depends on which lesson is being taught. For some, it is those who have no knowledge of the skills and techniques that are being presented, while others are for people with at least a base knowledge of the concepts.
3) Would you consider The Programming Historian a work of techniical writing/communication? Why? Or, if not, why not?
  I believe that it is a form of technical writing. It is not only teaching skills to people who may not have any knowledge of a subject, but it is also doing so in multiple facets whether that is giving the history of how it was used, teaching a step-by-step process to performing the technique, to even giving different tips and tricks that make the process more efficient. It is taking the knowledge that the experts have and breaking it down into a form that the non-experts would be able to understand.
